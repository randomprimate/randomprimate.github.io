## Intro

The description from the main [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) site is:

> At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript
applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a
dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or
more bundles.

So in simpler terms Webpack bundles the dependencies used in a JavaScript
application.

Note that it doesn't specify JavaScript dependencies, this means you can also
bundle dependencies for TypeScript, Babel, Sass, Less and even plain text.
It does this through Loaders that we can either select from a list of
pre-existing ones or create our own.

A key concept in the description is the _module_. This comes from the modular
programming design technique that separates code into independent functional
pieces.

The following content will get us up and running with a practical example using
Webpack.


## Install

Install with npm:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
npm install --save-dev webpack
npm install --save-dev webpack@<version>
{% endhighlight %}

For Webpack v4 or later install the cli:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
{% endhighlight %}

## Webpack Setup

Let's create a directory to install Webpack locally. We'll use the official
documentation's guide for this.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
mkdir webpack-project && cd webpack-project
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
{% endhighlight %}

Now create the `index.js` and `index.html` files in the following directory
structure:

{% highlight diff linenos %}
 webpack-project
  |- package.json
+ |- /dist
+   |- index.html
+ |- /src
+   |- index.js
{% endhighlight %}

This structure has a directory for our source code which holds our development
and it also has a directory for distribution which will hold minimized and
optimized code.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// /src/index.js
import _ from 'lodash';

function component() {
  var element = document.createElement('div');

  element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');

  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!-- /dist/index.html -->

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>Getting Started</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Remove the `main` entry from `package.json` and replace it with `private: true`.

Now let's bundle with `npx webpack`. In this command `npx` is a Node tool,
shipped with Node, that runs binaries from npm packages.

## Configuration file

Our project will require additional modules and instructions so even tho Webpack
doesn't need this we will still use it to keep things tidy.

Create a file in the root of the directory `touch webpack.config.js` and add
the following layout:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}   
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

* `entry` refers to the module Webpack should use to start building a dependency
graph.
* `output` is used to tell Webpack where to put the bundles it creates. In our
file above we specify the directory in one option and the file name in another.

Now we can run the build but no need to add any flags, the config file is picked
up automatcially, although if you're using a specific name then you can use
`--config <config-file-name>`.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npx webpack
{% endhighlight %}

Now before moving forward we can add a shortcut, let's include a script in our
`package.json` file to build our project.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{
   "name": "webpack-project",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "description": "",
   "main": "index.js",
   "scripts": {
     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
+     "build": "webpack"
   },
   "keywords": [],
   "author": "",
   "license": "ISC",
   "devDependencies": {
     "webpack": "^4.0.1",
     "webpack-cli": "^2.0.9",
     "lodash": "^4.17.5"
   }
 }
 {% endhighlight %}

 We can now use `npm run build`.

## Asset Management

We'll now learn how to apply the same bundling principle to our css, images,
fonts and data. This would substitute the use of other tools such as `gulp` or
`grunt`.


### Loading CSS

First let's add the style-loader and css-loader to our module configuration:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
{% endhighlight %}

In the `webpack.config.js` file add the following in the same level as entry and
output:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
module: {
 rules: [
   {
     test: /\.css$/,
     use: [
       'style-loader',
       'css-loader'
     ]
   }
 ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add a `style.css` to the `src` directory. Add to it the following style:

{% highlight css linenos %}
.hello {
  color: red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally add `import './style.css';` to the top of the `src/index.js` file and
`element.classList.add('hello');` over the `return element;` line. Run the build
with `npm run build`. Consider minifying the css before requiring as well as
using `sass` and `less`.

### Loading Images

Let's use the file-loader for our images.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npm install --save-dev file-loader
{% endhighlight %}

Now add the following to our `webpack.config.js` as a second element of the
rules we added earlier.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{
  test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|gif)$/,
  use: [
   'file-loader'
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now in our `src/index.js` we'll add

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
import Icon from './icon.png';
{% endhighlight %}

to the top of the file and

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var myIcon = new Image();
myIcon.src = Icon;

element.appendChild(myIcon);
{% endhighlight %}

over the `return element;` line. In our `src/style.css` we wil add our image
right under the `color: red` line.

{% highlight css linenos %}
background: url('./icon.png');
{% endhighlight %}

We can finally build and explore the result in our `index.html`.

### Loading Fonts

We can actually use the same file-loader for our fonts. So no need to install a
package all we need is to add a rule in our `webpack.config.js`.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{
  test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/,
  use: [
    'file-loader'
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can include the fonts in our `src` and then add them through our
`src/style.css` in the following way:

{% highlight css linenos %}
+ @font-face {
+   font-family: 'MyFont';
+   src:  url('./my-font.woff2') format('woff2'),
+         url('./my-font.woff') format('woff');
+   font-weight: 600;
+   font-style: normal;
+ }

  .hello {
    color: red;
+   font-family: 'MyFont';
    background: url('./icon.png');
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Now rebuild the project and try it out.

### Loading Data

To import data in `csv` or `xml` we can use another loader, let's install it:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npm install --save-dev csv-loader xml-loader
{% endhighlight %}

Again we'll have to add the rule to our `webpack.config.js` file:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{
  test: /\.(csv|tsv)$/,
  use: [
    'csv-loader'
  ]
},
{
  test: /\.xml$/,
  use: [
    'xml-loader'
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try this out with the following data file in `src/data.xml`.

{% highlight xml linenos %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Mary</to>
  <from>John</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Call Cindy on Tuesday</body>
</note>
{% endhighlight %}

When importing this in our `src/index.js` file we can use it as `json` data.
This is specially useful for data visualization such as using D3.

Add `import Data from './data.xml';` to the top of the file and
`console.log(Data);` above `return element;`.

Build the project and try the console in the browser widnow this time to see the
data output of the xml file.


## Component structure

Besides being able to use a global `assets` directory we can also use another
structure where we have all the closely coupled files inside one directory.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
- |- /assets
+ |– /components
+ |  |– /my-component
+ |  |  |– index.jsx
+ |  |  |– index.css
+ |  |  |– icon.svg
+ |  |  |– img.png
{% endhighlight %}

## Auto setup and cleanup

There are two plugins recommended by the official guide, both are meant to
improve the way we manage our Webpack.

### HtmlWebpackPlugin

To avoid having to keep track of the entry points in our `index.html` file in
case of renaming or removal we have a plugin that generates this file on build
every time. Let's install it:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
const path = require('path');
+ const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: './src/index.js',
    print: './src/print.js'
  },
+   plugins: [
+     new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
+       title: 'Getting Started'
+     })
+   ],
  output: {
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Now every time we run `npm run build` the `dist/index.html` will be re created.

### clean-webpack-plugin

Our `dist/` directory keeps all the bundles but Webpack doesn't know which ones
aren't used anymore. To keep this directory clean we'll install another plguin.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npm install clean-webpack-plugin --save-dev
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
+ const CleanWebpackPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

 module.exports = {
   entry: {
     app: './src/index.js',
     print: './src/print.js'
   },
   plugins: [
+     new CleanWebpackPlugin(['dist']),
     new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
       title: 'Output Management'
     })
   ],
   output: {
     filename: '[name].bundle.js',
     path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
   }
 };
{% endhighlight %}

now after every build we will only have files relevant to the current build.

## Development

When we have an issue in any of our js files our debugger such as the developer
tools will point to the bundle file and not to the exact file where the error
occurred, to avoid this behavior we will use an option in the
`webpack.config.js` file that will output the relevant information to improve
our debugging work flow. These options should only be added in development.

Add `devtool: 'inline-source-map',` under the entry object.

Now let's bring up a dev server to host all the development files.

Install it with:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
{% endhighlight %}

Under devtool add the follwing snippet:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
devServer: {
  contentBase: './dist'
},
{% endhighlight %}

This will bring up our dev server at `localhost:8080`.

We can also improve this abit by adding it as a start script within our
`package.json` file.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
"start": "webpack-dev-server --open",
{% endhighlight %}

### Build for each Environment

When building we can decide to use development or production. What changes are
the defaults for example development has:
* Tooling for in browser debugging
* Fast incremental compilation for a fast development cycle
* Useful error messages at runtime.

While production has:
* Small output size
* Fast code at runtime
* Omitting development-only code
* Not exposing source code or file paths
* Easy to use output assets

So to make sure you are building the for the correct environment add a couple of
scripts to you `package.json` file:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
"build-dev": "webpack --mode development",
"build-prod": "webpack --mode production"
{% endhighlight %}

## Final Thoughts

Webpack is a very powerful tool that improves how we manage our JavaScript
application. The additional concept that I would like to put out there is that
Webpack also suggests a workflow and best practices when leveraging modules,
allowing for component based directory structures, and much more options.

Many big tools are using Webpack as part of their framework or are compatible
with it at some level so learning to use it not only allows you to build your
project with this but also to better understand other tools.
